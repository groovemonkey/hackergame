# hacker

Apparently I love text adventures, because I keep making them.

Hacker (or Hackergame) is a simple text-game where you play a hacker, able to 

       +take on missions, 
       +buy new equipment, 
       +upgrade your skills, and 
       +do other cool stuff.

The goal is to build the game, and then make it playable in the browser, as a web service (like tryclojure or himera).


## Usage
If you clone this repository, make sure you have leiningen installed.  Then just go to the project root and run

       //lein trampoline run

The "trampoline" is needed to make calls to (read-line) -- getting user input from the command line -- work correctly.
