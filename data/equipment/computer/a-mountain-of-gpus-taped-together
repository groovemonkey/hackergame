:description "This is an abomination. But hey, it's fast. You've taken several old computer cases and filled them with linked GPUs. A single linux machine runs the whole thing as a computing cluster, and you achieve speeds that most people are paying ten times as much for. It's ugly, and there's a lot of duct tape showing...but shit, it works."
