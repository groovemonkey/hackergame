:name "Let's not play games -- this thing is stolen. How you stole it -- it's the size of several washing machines -- is not up for discussion. Where it was stolen from is equally irrelevant. The only thing that matters is that this is the fastest, craziest, most high-end ride in town. We're talking magnitude-of-order faster than the next sucker down the line.  We're talking batshit, crazy-insane fast. The Quantum Rig uses superposition and quantum entanglement to make code run 10,000 times faster than one of these old-fashioned van Neumann machines on the market. Just don't look at the electricity bill."
