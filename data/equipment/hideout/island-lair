:name "Island Lair"
:description "Enough of the distractions of civilization. You're moving away from the city -- *far* away. You managed to get a great deal on a small island in the South Pacific, setting up a hacking compound and security systems that would make the old guy from Jurassic Park jealous. No, seriously -- you're being guarded by Velociraptors. The place came with your own helicopter and a network pipe larger than most countries' backbones. As you sit back and sip your Pina Colada, you realize that you've become one happy hacker."
