:description "Now with twinkie wrappers! You've realized that there are better ways to communicate your needs to a computer than by ham-fistedly dragging a mouse around, aiming at certain microscopic sections of the screen, clicking around like a blind, idiotic child, and hoping for the best. Your initial horror at having to learn specific commands on a 'command line' has subsided and you've decided to study the 'linux' running underneath your glossy interface. As a result you're now 10-20 times faster than you were before. Congratulations. You're now a computer user."
