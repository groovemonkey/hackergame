:name "Emacs, Baby"
:description "OK, enough fucking around. It's time to get serious about efficiency. This is a costly switch -- requiring several weeks of time for learning and adjustment -- but gradually you start using emacs for everything. It's an e-mail client. A calendar. An organizer and a notetaking program. An outliner, an Integrated Development Environment with all the bells and whistles, a blog posting app, chat software, a replacement for the OS command line. Once you've learned it, you've learned hundreds of programs -- the same keyboard shortcuts and commands work everywhere. It does everything short of sucking your cock and making you a sandwich...and you're starting to suspect there's a plugin for that."
