:1 {:description "Programming is pretty cool.  You can...you know...get the computer to do stuff that you tell it.  And it's like a fun little logical puzzle.  Others play sudoku, you program little games.  Cool!"
:skill-points-required 10}

:2 {:description "You're comfortable using BASIC."
:skill-points-required 100}

:3 {:description "You've built a few small games and utilities. This programming stuff is cool!"
:skill-points-required 1000}

:4 {:description "You know a few languages.  Python, Ruby, C++.  You can build useful stuff when you need it."
:skill-points-required 10000}

:5 {:description "You've built up a fairly large set of scripts and utilities that help you run your network -- and your life.  You're competent."
:skill-points-required 100000}

:6 {:description "Hmmm, what's this LISP stuff? You're starting to discover functional programming, and rewriting your code library to make it more simple, elegant, and less prone to side effects."
:skill-points-required 1000000}

:7 {:description "You're writing device drivers for hardware your friends build...when you're not busy modifying your operating system and discovering loopholes and flaws."
:skill-points-required 10000000}

:8 {:description "Welcome to badass-hacker land. You've discovered flaws in major software packages, operating systems, and hardware devices. You start mentally deconstructing complex systems almost as soon as you see them, whether it's a new piece of software or a city's transportation system. Making you angry is not a smart move."
:skill-points-required 100000000}

:9 {:description "You are a LISP god. Governments and large organizations develop contingency plans for you. Other hackers aspire to *be* you. You can write large systems without much trouble, and tend to get things right the first time. You can think of an easy way to accomplish almost anything."
