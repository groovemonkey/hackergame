:description "You've had so many ideas for cool little games since you started programming: time to build one of them into something real. Break out the reference books and search engine; it's programming time!"

:completion-description "You have successfully turned a glimmer of an idea into something real: a pretty sweet little game that you and your friends can play. Not only do you have the finished product to enjoy, but when you look back you realize how much you've had to learn to make it happen. You've gained some valuable programming skills, even though it just seemed like fun."
